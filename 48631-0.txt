THE FORGED WILL.

BY EMERSON BENNETT,

AUTHOR OF "CLARA MORELAND," "VIOLA," "PIONEER'S DAUGHTER," ETC.

THIS CELEBRATED AND BEAUTIFUL WORK is published complete in one large
volume, of over 300 pages, paper cover, price FIFTY CENTS; or the work
is handsomely bound in one volume, cloth, gilt, price ONE DOLLAR.

ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES OF THE FORGED WILL will be sold in a short
time, and it will have a run and popularity second only to Uncle Tom's
Cabin. The Press everywhere are unanimous in its praise, as being one
of the most powerfully written works in the language.

THE FORGED WILL is truly a celebrated work. It has been running
through the columns of the Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper, where it has
been appearing for ten weeks, and has proved itself to be one of the
most popular nouvelettes that has ever appeared in the columns of any
newspaper in this country. Before the fourth paper appeared, the back
numbers, (although several thousand extra of the three former numbers
were printed,) could not be obtained at any price, and the publishers
of the paper were forced to issue a Supplement sheet of the first
three papers of it, for new subscribers to their paper, which induced
the publisher to make an arrangement with the popular author to bring
it out in a beautiful style for the thousands that wish it in book
form.

If Emerson Bennett had never written his many delightful and thrilling
stories of border life, of prairie scenes, and Indian warfare, this
new story of the 'FORGED WILL' would have placed his name
on the record as one of the best of American novelists. The scenes,
principally, of this most captivating novel, are laid in the city of
New York; and most glowingly the author pictures to us how the guilty
may, for a time, escape the justice of the law, but only to feel the
heavy hand of retribution sooner or later; how vice may, for a time,
triumph over virtue, but only for a time; how crime may lie concealed,
until its very security breeds exposure; how true virtue gives way to
no temptation, but bears the ills of life with patience, hoping for a
better day, and rejoices triumphant in the end. In short, from base
hypocrisy he tears the veil that hides its huge deformity, and gives a
true picture of life as it exists in the crowded city. We do cordially
recommend this book for its excellent moral. It is one that should be
circulated, for it _must_ do good.

Price for the complete work, in one volume, in paper cover, Fifty
Cents only; or a finer edition, printed on thicker and better paper,
and handsomely bound in one volume, muslin, gilt, is published for One
Dollar.

CLARA MORELAND.

BY EMERSON BENNETT.

Price Fifty Cents in Paper Cover; or, One Dollar in Cloth, Gilt.

READ THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.


     "This is decidedly the best novel Mr. Bennett has written.
     He tells his story well, and while leading the reader over
     the prairies of Texas into the haunts of the wild Indians,
     or among the equally savage bands of lawless men, that
     once were the terror of that country; he presents the
     remarkable transitions in the fortunes of his hero, in a
     manner which, though often startling, are yet within the
     bounds of probability. His dialogue is good, growing easily
     out of the situation and condition of the interlocutors,
     and presenting occasionally, especially in response, an
     epigrammatic poise, that is worthy of all praise. The
     plot abounds with adventure, and presents many scenes
     of startling interest, while the denouement is such as
     to amply satisfy the most fastidious reader's ideas of
     poetical justice. We would add a few words of praise for
     the excellent style in which this book is gotten up. It
     is well printed on good paper, and bound in a manner to
     correspond with the quality of its typography."--_Arthur's
     Home Gazette._

     "This is the best of Mr. Bennett's books. It is a brilliant
     and thrilling production, and will particularly interest
     all who love to read of life in the West and South-West.
     A love story runs through the volume, lending grace and
     finish to it. Mr. Peterson has issued the book in very
     handsome style; the type is new and of honest size, the
     binding is strong and pretty, the paper is firm and white,
     and the embellishments are eminently creditable. Clara
     Moreland should command a large sale."--_Philadelphia City
     Item._

     "On looking more carefully through this racy, spirited
     narrative of thrilling scenes and well-told adventures,
     we meet with beauties that escape a casual observation.
     Mr. Bennett is a keen discoverer of character, and paints
     his portraits so true to nature as to carry the reader
     with him through all his wild wanderings and with unabated
     interest. The author of 'Clara Moreland' takes rank among
     the most popular American novelists, and aided by the
     great energy of his publisher is fast becoming a general
     favorite."--_McMackin's Model Saturday Courier._

     "Emerson Bennett has written some very creditable
     productions. This is one of his longest, and is
     well received. Mr. Bennett is a favorite author
     with Western readers. It is illustrated and well
     printed."--_Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper._

     "It is a tale of wild border life and exciting incident,
     bustle, and turmoil."--_Philadelphia North American._

     "Mr. Bennett is, in some measure, a new man in this section
     of the universe, and, as such, our reading public are
     bound to give him a cordial greeting, not only for this,
     but for the sake of that wide-spread popularity which he
     has achieved in the mighty West, and more especially for
     the intrinsic excellence that distinguishes his glowing,
     brilliant productions, of which 'Clara Moreland' may be
     pronounced the best."--_Philadelphia Saturday Courier._

     "This work is of the most exciting character, and will be
     enjoyed by all who have a cultivated taste."--_Baltimore
     Sun._

     "The scene of this interesting Romance lies in Texas before
     or during the late war with Mexico. It is written with a
     great deal of spirit; it abounds in stirring incidents
     and adventures, has a good love-plot interwoven with
     it, and is in many respects a faithful representation
     of Life in the Far South-West. Mr. Bennett is destined
     to great popularity, especially at the South and West.
     His publisher has issued this book in a very handsome
     style."--_Philadelphia Evening Bulletin._

     "This is a thrilling story of frontier life, full of
     incident, and graphically sketched. It is published in a
     good style."--_Philadelphia Public Ledger._

     "This is a spirited narrative of stirring scenes,
     by Emerson Bennett. Those who love daring adventure
     and hair-breadth escapes will find it an engaging
     book."--_Detroit, Mich., Paper._

     "It is a thrilling narrative of South-Western adventure,
     illustrated by numerous engravings."--_Detroit, Mich.,
     Paper._

     "It is a wondrous story of thrilling adventures and
     hair-breadth escapes, the scene of which is laid in the
     South-West. The book is illustrated with engravings
     representing some of the exciting events narrated by the
     writer."--_Detroit, Mich., Paper._

     "It is a work replete with stirring adventure. Romance,
     incident, and accident, are blended together so as to
     form a highly interesting work of 334 pages."--_New York
     Picayune._

VIOLA;

OR,

ADVENTURES IN THE FAR SOUTH-WEST

BY EMERSON BENNETT,

     AUTHOR OF "CLARA MORELAND," "FORGED WILL," "KATE
     CLARENDON," "BRIDE OF THE WILDERNESS," "WALDE-WARREN,"
     "PIONEER'S DAUGHTER," ETC., ETC.

READ THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS OF THE PRESS:


     "We have perused this work with some attention, and do not
     hesitate to pronounce it one of the very best productions
     of the talented author. The scenes are laid in Texas, and
     the adjoining frontier. There is not a page that does not
     glow with thrilling and interesting incident, and will well
     repay the reader for the time occupied in perusing it. The
     characters are most admirably drawn, and are perfectly
     natural throughout. We have derived so much gratification
     from the perusal of this charming novel, that we are
     anxious to make our readers share it with us; and, at the
     same time, to recommend it to be read by all persons who
     are fond of romantic adventures. Mr. Bennett is a spirited
     and vigorous writer, and his works deserve to be generally
     read; not only because they are well written, but that
     they are, in most part, taken from events connected with
     the history of our own country, from which much valuable
     information is derived, and should, therefore, have a
     double claim upon our preference, over those works where
     the incidents are gleaned from the romantic legends of
     old castles, and foreign climes. The book is printed on
     fine paper, and is in every way got up in a style highly
     creditable to the enterprising publisher."

     "It is a spirited tale of frontier life, of which 'Clara
     Moreland' is the sequel and conclusion. Mr. Bennett
     seems to delight in that field of action and adventure,
     where Cooper won his laurels; and which is perhaps the
     most captivating to the general mind of all the walks
     of fiction. There has been, so far, we think, a steady
     improvement in his style and stories; and his popularity,
     as a necessary consequence, has been and is increasing.
     One great secret of the popularity of these out-door
     novels, as we may call them, is that there is a freshness
     and simplicity of the open air and natural world about
     them--free from the closeness, intensity and artificiality
     of the gas-lighted world revealed in works that treat of
     the vices and dissipations of large cities."--_Philadelphia
     Saturday Evening Post._

     "This is one of the best productions of Mr. Bennett.
     The scenes are in and near Texas. Every page glows with
     thrilling interest, and the characters are well drawn and
     sustained. An interesting love plot runs through the book,
     which gives a faithful representation of life in the far
     South-West. Mr. Peterson has issued VIOLA in his usual neat
     style, and it is destined to have a great run."--_Clinton
     Tribune._

     "We have received the above work and found time to give
     it an examination. The scenes are laid mostly in Texas,
     and pictured with all the vividness for which the author
     is so celebrated. Those who are particularly fond of wild
     and romantic adventures may safely calculate upon finding
     'Viola' suited to their taste. It is well written and
     handsomely printed."--_Daily Journal, Chicago, Ill._

     "It is a very interesting book. The scenes of this most
     exciting and interesting Romance are found in Texas before
     and during the late Mexican war. It is written with much
     spirit and pathos, and abounds in stirring incidents and
     adventures, and has an interesting and romantic love-plot
     interwoven with it; and is a faithful representation of
     'Life in the Far South-West.' The author of 'VIOLA,'
     will rank among the most popular of American Novelists,
     and aided by the great energy and enterprise of his
     publisher, T. B. Peterson, is fast becoming a general
     favorite."--_Gazette, Rhinebeck, N. Y._

     "This thrilling and interesting novel--equal to anything
     the celebrated author ever wrote--has been issued in a
     fifty cent volume; and we would advise every one who
     wants to get the value of his money, to get the book.
     Bennett's works are the most interesting of any now
     published."--_Western Emporium, Germantown, Ohio._

is handsomely bound in one volume, cloth, gilt, price SEVENTY-FIVE
CENTS.

GREAT INDUCEMENTS FOR 1857.

NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE UP CLUBS.

PETERSON'S MAGAZINE

THE BEST AND CHEAPEST IN THE WORLD FOR LADIES.


This popular Magazine, already the cheapest and best Monthly of its
kind in the World, _will be greatly improved for 1857_. It will
contain 900 pages of double-column reading matter; from twenty to
thirty Steel Plates; and _Five Hundred_ Wood Engravings: which is
proportionately more than any periodical, of any price, ever yet gave.


ITS THRILLING ORIGINAL STORIES

Are pronounced by the newspaper press, _the best published anywhere_.
The editors are Mrs. Ann S. Stephens, author of "The Old Homestead,"
"Fashion and Famine," and Charles J. Peterson, author of "Mabel,"
"Kate Aylesford," "The Valley Farm," etc. They are assisted by a corps
of original contributors, such as no lady's Magazine ever had. Mrs.
E. D. E. N. Southworth, author of "The Lost Heiress," "Retribution,"
etc., etc., is engaged to write a nouvelletté for 1857. Alice Cary,
Virginia F. Townsend. Caroline E. Fairfield, Hetty Holyoke, E. W.
Dewees, Ella Rodman, Carry Stanley, Clara Moreton, Ellen Ashton, etc.,
etc., will also contribute regularly. New talent is continually being
added, _regardless of expense_, so as to keep "Peterson's Magazine"
unapproachable in merit. Morality and virtue are always inculcated.


Its Colored Fashion Plates in Advance.

[ph] It is the only Magazine whose Fashion Plates can be relied on. [ph]

Each number contains a Fashion Plate, engraved on Steel, colored _à la
mode_, and of unrivalled beauty. The Paris, London, Philadelphia, and
New York Fashions are described, at length, each month. Every number
also contains a dozen or more New Styles, engraved on Wood. Also, a
Pattern, from which a Dress, Mantilla, or Child's Costume, can be cut
without the aid of a mantua-maker, so that each number, in this way,
will _save a year's subscription_.


Its superb MEZZOTINTS, and other STEEL ENGRAVINGS.

Its Illustrations excel those of any other Magazine, each number
containing a superb Steel Engraving, either mezzotint or line, besides
the Fashion Plate; and, in addition, numerous other Engravings, Wood
Cuts, Patterns, etc., etc. The Engravings, at the end of the year,
_alone_ are worth the subscription price.


PATTERNS FOR CROTCHET, NEEDLEWORK, ETC.

In the greatest profusion, are given in every number, with
instructions how to work them also, Patterns in Embroidery, Inserting,
Broiderie Anglaise, Netting, Lace-making, etc., etc. Also, Patterns
for Sleeves, Collars, and Chemisettes; Patterns in Bead-work,
Hair-work, Shell-work; Handkerchief Corners; Names for Marking and
Initials. A piece of new and fashionable Music is also published every
month. On the whole, it is the _most complete Ladies' Magazine in the
World_. TRY IT FOR ONE YEAR.

T. B. PETERSON'S

WHOLESALE AND RETAIL

Cheap Book, Magazine, Newspaper, Publishing and Bookselling
Establishment, is at

No. 102 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.


T. B. PETERSON has the satisfaction to announce to the public, that
he has removed to the new and spacious BROWN STONE BUILDING, NO. 102
CHESTNUT STREET, just completed by the city authorities on the Girard
Estate, known as the most central and best situation in the city of
Philadelphia. As it is the Model Book Store of the Country, we will
describe it: It is the largest, most spacious, and best arranged
Retail and Wholesale Cheap Book and Publishing Establishment in the
United States. It is built, by the Girard Estate, of Connecticut
sand-stone, in a richly ornamental style. The whole front of the
lower story, except that taken up by the doorway, is occupied by two
large plate glass windows, a single plate to each window, costing
together over three thousand dollars. On entering and looking up, you
find above you a ceiling sixteen feet high; while, on gazing before,
you perceive a vista of One Hundred and Fifty-Seven feet. The retail
counters extend back for eighty feet, and, being double, afford
counter-room of One Hundred and Sixty feet in length. There is also
_over Three Thousand feet of shelving in the retail part of the store
alone_. This part is devoted to the retail business, and as it is the
most spacious in the country, furnishes also the best and largest
assortment of all kinds of books to be found in the country. It is
fitted up in the most superb style; the shelvings are all painted in
Florence white, with gilded cornices for the book shelves.

Behind the retail part of the store, at about ninety feet from the
entrance, is the counting-room, twenty feet square, railed neatly off,
and surmounted by a most beautiful dome of stained glass. In the rear
of this is the wholesale and packing department, extending a further
distance of about sixty feet, with desks and packing counters for the
establishment, etc., etc. All goods are received and shipped from the
back of the store, having a fine avenue on the side of Girard Bank for
the purpose, leading out to Third Street, so as not to interfere with
and block up the front of the store of Chestnut Street. The cellar, of
the entire depth of the store, is filled with printed copies of Mr.
Peterson's own publications, printed from his own stereotype plates,
of which he generally keeps on hand an edition of a thousand each,
making a stock, of his own publications alone, of over three hundred
thousand volumes, constantly on hand.

T. B. PETERSON is warranted in saying, that he is able to offer
such inducements to the Trade, and all others, to favor him with
their orders, as cannot be excelled by any book establishment in the
country. In proof of this, T. B. PETERSON begs leave to refer to his
great facilities of getting stock of all kinds, his dealing direct
with all the Publishing Houses in the country, and also to his own
long list of Publications, consisting of the best and most popular
productions of the most talented authors of the United States and
Great Britain, and to his very extensive stock, embracing every work,
new or old, published in the United States.

T. B. PETERSON will be most happy to supply all orders for any books
at all, no matter by whom published, in advance of all others, and
at publishers' lowest cash prices. He respectfully invites Country
Merchants, Booksellers, Pedlars, Canvassers, Agents, the Trade,
Strangers in the city, and the public generally, to call and examine
his extensive collection of cheap and standard publications of all
kinds, comprising a most magnificent collection of CHEAP BOOKS,
MAGAZINES, NOVELS, STANDARD and POPULAR WORKS of all kinds, BIBLES,
PRAYER BOOKS, ANNUALS, GIFT BOOKS, ILLUSTRATED WORKS, ALBUMS and
JUVENILE WORKS of all kinds, GAMES of all kinds, to suit all ages,
tastes, etc., which he is selling to his customers and the public at
much lower prices than they can be purchased elsewhere. Being located
at No. 102 CHESTNUT Street, the great thoroughfare of the city, and
BUYING his stock outright in large quantities, and not selling on
commission, he can and will sell them on such terms as will defy all
competition. Call and examine our stock, you will find it to be the
best, largest and cheapest in the city; and you will also be sure to
find all the _best, latest, popular, and cheapest works_ published in
this country or elsewhere, for sale at the lowest prices.

[ph] Call in person and examine our stock, or send your orders _by mail
direct_, to the CHEAP BOOKSELLING and PUBLISHING ESTABLISHMENT of
