<p>THIS CELEBRATED AND BEAUTIFUL WORK is published complete in one large

is handsomely bound in one volume, cloth, gilt, price ONE DOLLAR.</p>

<p>ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND COPIES OF THE FORGED WILL will be sold in a short
time, and it will have a run and popularity second only to Uncle Tom's
Cabin. The Press everywhere are unanimous in its praise, as being one
of the most powerfully written works in the language.</p>

<p>THE FORGED WILL is truly a celebrated work. It has been running
through the columns of the Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper, where it has
been appearing for ten weeks, and has proved itself to be one of the
most popular nouvelettes that has ever appeared in the columns of any
newspaper in this country. Before the fourth paper appeared, the back
numbers, (although several thousand extra of the three former numbers
were printed,) could not be obtained at any price, and the publishers
of the paper were forced to issue a Supplement sheet of the first
three papers of it, for new subscribers to their paper, which induced
the publisher to make an arrangement with the popular author to bring
it out in a beautiful style for the thousands that wish it in book
form.</p>

<p>If Emerson Bennett had never written his many delightful and thrilling
stories of border life, of prairie scenes, and Indian warfare, this
new story of the '<span class="smcap">Forged Will</span>' would have placed his name
on the record as one of the best of American novelists. The scenes,
principally, of this most captivating novel, are laid in the city of
New York; and most glowingly the author pictures to us how the guilty
may, for a time, escape the justice of the law, but only to feel the
heavy hand of retribution sooner or later; how vice may, for a time,
triumph over virtue, but only for a time; how crime may lie concealed,
until its very security breeds exposure; how true virtue gives way to
no temptation, but bears the ills of life with patience, hoping for a
better day, and rejoices triumphant in the end. In short, from base
hypocrisy he tears the veil that hides its huge deformity, and gives a
true picture of life as it exists in the crowded city. We do cordially
recommend this book for its excellent moral. It is one that should be
circulated, for it <em>must</em> do good.</p>

<p>Price for the complete work, in one volume, in paper cover, Fifty
Cents only; or a finer edition, printed on thicker and better paper,
and handsomely bound in one volume, muslin, gilt, is published for One

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This is decidedly the best novel Mr. Bennett has written. He tells
his story well, and while leading the reader over the prairies of
Texas into the haunts of the wild Indians, or among the equally savage
bands of lawless men, that once were the terror of that country; he
presents the remarkable transitions in the fortunes of his hero, in
a manner which, though often startling, are yet within the bounds of
probability. His dialogue is good, growing easily out of the situation
and condition of the interlocutors, and presenting occasionally,
especially in response, an epigrammatic poise, that is worthy of all
praise. The plot abounds with adventure, and presents many scenes of
startling interest, while the denouement is such as to amply satisfy
the most fastidious reader's ideas of poetical justice. We would add
a few words of praise for the excellent style in which this book is
gotten up. It is well printed on good paper, and bound in a manner
to correspond with the quality of its typography."&mdash;<em>Arthur's Home
Gazette.</em></p>

<p>"This is the best of Mr. Bennett's books. It is a brilliant and
thrilling production, and will particularly interest all who love to
read of life in the West and South-West. A love story runs through the
volume, lending grace and finish to it. Mr. Peterson has issued the
book in very handsome style; the type is new and of honest size, the
binding is strong and pretty, the paper is firm and white, and the
embellishments are eminently creditable. Clara Moreland should command
a large sale."&mdash;<em>Philadelphia City Item.</em></p>

<p>"On looking more carefully through this racy, spirited narrative of
thrilling scenes and well-told adventures, we meet with beauties
that escape a casual observation. Mr. Bennett is a keen discoverer
of character, and paints his portraits so true to nature as to carry
the reader with him through all his wild wanderings and with unabated
interest. The author of 'Clara Moreland' takes rank among the most
popular American novelists, and aided by the great energy of his
publisher is fast becoming a general favorite."&mdash;<em>McMackin's Model
Saturday Courier.</em></p>

turmoil."&mdash;<em>Philadelphia North American.</em></p>

<p class="center">READ THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS OF THE PRESS:</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We have perused this work with some attention, and do not hesitate to
pronounce it one of the very best productions of the talented author.
The scenes are laid in Texas, and the adjoining frontier. There is not
a page that does not glow with thrilling and interesting incident,
and will well repay the reader for the time occupied in perusing it.
The characters are most admirably drawn, and are perfectly natural
throughout. We have derived so much gratification from the perusal of
this charming novel, that we are anxious to make our readers share
it with us; and, at the same time, to recommend it to be read by all
persons who are fond of romantic adventures. Mr. Bennett is a spirited
and vigorous writer, and his works deserve to be generally read; not
only because they are well written, but that they are, in most part,
taken from events connected with the history of our own country, from
which much valuable information is derived, and should, therefore,
have a double claim upon our preference, over those works where the
incidents are gleaned from the romantic legends of old castles, and
foreign climes. The book is printed on fine paper, and is in every way
got up in a style highly creditable to the enterprising publisher."</p>

<p>"It is a spirited tale of frontier life, of which 'Clara Moreland' is
the sequel and conclusion. Mr. Bennett seems to delight in that field
of action and adventure, where Cooper won his laurels; and which is
perhaps the most captivating to the general mind of all the walks of
fiction. There has been, so far, we think, a steady improvement in his
style and stories; and his popularity, as a necessary consequence, has
been and is increasing. One great secret of the popularity of these
out-door novels, as we may call them, is that there is a freshness and
simplicity of the open air and natural world about them&mdash;free from
the closeness, intensity and artificiality of the gas-lighted world
revealed in works that treat of the vices and dissipations of large
cities."&mdash;<em>Philadelphia Saturday Evening Post.</em></p>

<p>"This is one of the best productions of Mr. Bennett. The scenes are
in and near Texas. Every page glows with thrilling interest, and the
characters are well drawn and sustained. An interesting love plot
runs through the book, which gives a faithful representation of life
in the far South-West. Mr. Peterson has issued <span class="smcap">Viola</span> in his
usual neat style, and it is destined to have a great run."&mdash;<em>Clinton
Tribune.</em></p>

<p>"We have received the above work and found time to give it an
examination. The scenes are laid mostly in Texas, and pictured with
all the vividness for which the author is so celebrated. Those who are
particularly fond of wild and romantic adventures may safely calculate
upon finding 'Viola' suited to their taste. It is well written and
handsomely printed."&mdash;<em>Daily Journal, Chicago, Ill.</em></p>

<p>"It is a very interesting book. The scenes of this most exciting and
interesting Romance are found in Texas before and during the late
Mexican war. It is written with much spirit and pathos, and abounds in
stirring incidents and adventures, and has an interesting and romantic
love-plot interwoven with it; and is a faithful representation of
'Life in the Far South-West.' The author of '<span class="smcap">Viola</span>,' will
rank among the most popular of American Novelists, and aided by the
great energy and enterprise of his publisher, T. B. Peterson, is fast
becoming a general favorite."&mdash;<em>Gazette, Rhinebeck, N. Y.</em></p>

<p>"This thrilling and interesting novel&mdash;equal to anything the
celebrated author ever wrote&mdash;has been issued in a fifty cent volume;
and we would advise every one who wants to get the value of his money,
to get the book. Bennett's works are the most interesting of any now
published."&mdash;<em>Western Emporium, Germantown, Ohio.</em></p></div>

<p class="ph2">PETERSON'S MAGAZINE</p>

<p class="ph4">THE BEST AND CHEAPEST IN THE WORLD FOR LADIES.</p>


<p>This popular Magazine, already the cheapest and best Monthly of its
kind in the World, <em>will be greatly improved for 1857</em>. It will
contain 900 pages of double-column reading matter; from twenty to
thirty Steel Plates; and <em>Five Hundred</em> Wood Engravings: which is
proportionately more than any periodical, of any price, ever yet gave.</p>


<p class="ph4">ITS THRILLING ORIGINAL STORIES</p>

<p>Are pronounced by the newspaper press, <em>the best published anywhere</em>.
The editors are Mrs. Ann S. Stephens, author of "The Old Homestead,"
"Fashion and Famine," and Charles J. Peterson, author of "Mabel,"
"Kate Aylesford," "The Valley Farm," etc. They are assisted by a corps
of original contributors, such as no lady's Magazine ever had. Mrs.
E. D. E. N. Southworth, author of "The Lost Heiress," "Retribution,"
etc., etc., is engaged to write a nouvelletté for 1857. Alice Cary,
Virginia F. Townsend. Caroline E. Fairfield, Hetty Holyoke, E. W.
Dewees, Ella Rodman, Carry Stanley, Clara Moreton, Ellen Ashton, etc.,
etc., will also contribute regularly. New talent is continually being
added, <em>regardless of expense</em>, so as to keep "Peterson's Magazine"
unapproachable in merit. Morality and virtue are always inculcated.</p>


<p class="ph4">Its Colored Fashion Plates in Advance.</p>

<p class="center">&#9758; It is the only Magazine whose Fashion Plates can be relied on. &#9756;</p>

<p>Each number contains a Fashion Plate, engraved on Steel, colored <em>à la
mode</em>, and of unrivalled beauty. The Paris, London, Philadelphia, and
New York Fashions are described, at length, each month. Every number
also contains a dozen or more New Styles, engraved on Wood. Also, a
Pattern, from which a Dress, Mantilla, or Child's Costume, can be cut
without the aid of a mantua-maker, so that each number, in this way,
will <em>save a year's subscription</em>.</p>


<p class="ph4">Its superb MEZZOTINTS, and other STEEL ENGRAVINGS.</p>

<p>Its Illustrations excel those of any other Magazine, each number
containing a superb Steel Engraving, either mezzotint or line, besides
the Fashion Plate; and, in addition, numerous other Engravings, Wood
Cuts, Patterns, etc., etc. The Engravings, at the end of the year,
<em>alone</em> are worth the subscription price.</p>

<p>T. B. PETERSON has the satisfaction to announce to the public, that
he has removed to the new and spacious BROWN STONE BUILDING, NO. 102
CHESTNUT STREET, just completed by the city authorities on the Girard
Estate, known as the most central and best situation in the city of
Philadelphia. As it is the Model Book Store of the Country, we will
describe it: It is the largest, most spacious, and best arranged
Retail and Wholesale Cheap Book and Publishing Establishment in the
United States. It is built, by the Girard Estate, of Connecticut
sand-stone, in a richly ornamental style. The whole front of the
lower story, except that taken up by the doorway, is occupied by two
large plate glass windows, a single plate to each window, costing
together over three thousand dollars. On entering and looking up, you
find above you a ceiling sixteen feet high; while, on gazing before,
you perceive a vista of One Hundred and Fifty-Seven feet. The retail
counters extend back for eighty feet, and, being double, afford
counter-room of One Hundred and Sixty feet in length. There is also
<em>over Three Thousand feet of shelving in the retail part of the store
alone</em>. This part is devoted to the retail business, and as it is the
most spacious in the country, furnishes also the best and largest
assortment of all kinds of books to be found in the country. It is
fitted up in the most superb style; the shelvings are all painted in
Florence white, with gilded cornices for the book shelves.</p>

<p>Behind the retail part of the store, at about ninety feet from the
entrance, is the counting-room, twenty feet square, railed neatly off,
and surmounted by a most beautiful dome of stained glass. In the rear
of this is the wholesale and packing department, extending a further
distance of about sixty feet, with desks and packing counters for the
establishment, etc., etc. All goods are received and shipped from the
back of the store, having a fine avenue on the side of Girard Bank for
the purpose, leading out to Third Street, so as not to interfere with
and block up the front of the store of Chestnut Street. The cellar, of
the entire depth of the store, is filled with printed copies of Mr.
Peterson's own publications, printed from his own stereotype plates,
of which he generally keeps on hand an edition of a thousand each,
making a stock, of his own publications alone, of over three hundred
thousand volumes, constantly on hand.</p>

<p>T. B. PETERSON is warranted in saying, that he is able to offer
such inducements to the Trade, and all others, to favor him with
their orders, as cannot be excelled by any book establishment in the
country. In proof of this, T. B. PETERSON begs leave to refer to his
great facilities of getting stock of all kinds, his dealing direct
with all the Publishing Houses in the country, and also to his own
long list of Publications, consisting of the best and most popular
productions of the most talented authors of the United States and
Great Britain, and to his very extensive stock, embracing every work,
new or old, published in the United States.</p>

<p>T. B. PETERSON will be most happy to supply all orders for any books
at all, no matter by whom published, in advance of all others, and
at publishers' lowest cash prices. He respectfully invites Country
Merchants, Booksellers, Pedlars, Canvassers, Agents, the Trade,
Strangers in the city, and the public generally, to call and examine
his extensive collection of cheap and standard publications of all
kinds, comprising a most magnificent collection of CHEAP BOOKS,
MAGAZINES, NOVELS, STANDARD and POPULAR WORKS of all kinds, BIBLES,
PRAYER BOOKS, ANNUALS, GIFT BOOKS, ILLUSTRATED WORKS, ALBUMS and
JUVENILE WORKS of all kinds, GAMES of all kinds, to suit all ages,
tastes, etc., which he is selling to his customers and the public at
much lower prices than they can be purchased elsewhere. Being located
at No. 102 CHESTNUT Street, the great thoroughfare of the city, and
BUYING his stock outright in large quantities, and not selling on
commission, he can and will sell them on such terms as will defy all
competition. Call and examine our stock, you will find it to be the
best, largest and cheapest in the city; and you will also be sure to
find all the <em>best, latest, popular, and cheapest works</em> published in
this country or elsewhere, for sale at the lowest prices.</p>

<p>&#9758; Call in person and examine our stock, or send your orders <em>by mail
direct</em>, to the CHEAP BOOKSELLING and PUBLISHING ESTABLISHMENT of</p>
